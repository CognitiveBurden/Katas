Ideas

- Fibonacci generation

- [x] Find the 44th prime number over 100,000. Bonus: print the next 4 primes (after the initial prime).

- [x] Create a tic-tac-toe (noughts and crosses) game: user versus machine. Print the 3x3 grid in a terminal 
  & accept input from the command-line; or create a web-based version; or any other UI.

- Implement a Sudoku solver

- Some good suggestions here; perhaps we could get the topic in advance, so we can set up the framework and only have to write core code on the night
