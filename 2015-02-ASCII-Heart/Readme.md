==================

...as ASCII  art!

Your art doesn't have to look exactly like this one, but it has to look like a Heart Shape.

The inside of of the heart has to contain the words "Love" at least 20 times

Rules The program must write the art to the console. Shortest code (in bytes, any language) wins (something, probably a glass of water :D ).
